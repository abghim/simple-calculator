# SimpleCalculator App
Rudimentary calculator app with interesting horizontal layout. This is my first project with SlintUI, a declarative UI framework with first-class support for rust.

This app can perform basic arithmetic calculations, functioning button by button with a single display. This means it behaves like a $10 digital calculator, without expressions and operators visible in a unified LCD.
